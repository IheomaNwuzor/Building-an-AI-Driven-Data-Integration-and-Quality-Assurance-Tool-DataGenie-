# Building-an-AI-Driven-Data-Integration-and-Quality-Assurance-Tool-DataGenie-
Many industries, businesses and analysts struggle with messy, inconsistent datasets, spending countless hours on manual cleaning that delays insights and decision-making. I was tasked with building an AI solution that could automate data cleaning, make it user-friendly, and provide measurable efficiency gains. I was tasked with building an AI solution that could automate data cleaning, make it user-friendly, and provide measurable efficiency gains.
I developed DataGenie, an AI-powered data cleaning platform with a drag-and-drop interface, intelligent issue detection, team collaboration features, and instant shareable outputs, all free and accessible without registration.
I tested my AI product and the platform has cleaned 2,847,392 datasets, fixed 15,293,847 issues, saved 142,847 hours, and gained 89,234 active users across 4,567 companies, transforming tedious data cleaning into a fast, efficient, and collaborative process while demonstrating strong viral growth potential.

### Design methodology:
Step 1: Brainstormed AI Product Idea
•	Problem: Cleaning and standardising large, heterogeneous datasets from multiple production lines is repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to errors.
•	Target Audience: Professionals, businesses, and recruiters who deal with multi-source datasets and need actionable insights quickly.
•	Simplicity & Value: Focus on automating validation, normalisation, missing value handling, and outlier detection in a single AI-powered platform.

Step 2: Product Details
•	Product Name: DataGenie
•	Main Problem It Solves: Reduces manual effort and time spent cleaning, validating, and merging heterogeneous datasets for analysis.
•	Target Users: Data professionals, business analysts, operations managers, and recruiters handling complex datasets.
•	Key Features :
1.	Automatic detection of inconsistent formats and timestamps
2.	Intelligent missing value imputation
3.	Outlier detection and flagging
4.	Merge and normalise multiple datasets into a unified structure
5.	Optional: Generate a summary report of data quality issues
•	User Input Required: Upload dataset files (CSV, Excel, JSON, or other common formats)
•	Expected Output: Cleaned, normalised, merged dataset ready for analysis, with optional data quality summary

Step 3. Problem & Purpose:
This product solves the tedious and error-prone task of cleaning, validating, and merging heterogeneous datasets for professionals, businesses, and industries.
Core Features: The web application features include:
1.	Automatic detection of inconsistent formats and timestamps
2.	Intelligent missing value imputation
